# Dictionary implementation in C

A naive implementation of python's dictionaries using a custom implementation of the md5 hash

Keys and Values can only be strings and void pointers respectively 
cause im **NOT** implementing a dynamic typing system `lmao`

Aditionally, for safety reasons, keys are only garanteed uniqueness for the first 64 characters

Mostly done for C practice
